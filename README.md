# Java Examination Year 2

## Description

This repository contains the files created for the Java for C++ programmers course taken as part of the Programvaruteknik program at Mid Sweden University 2019.

The test was divided into Tasks where the first was to write a word randomizer program. The second to build a GUI for a client and server application. The final tasks of the examination was meant to be the actual connection and methods of sending words to randomize from client to server. Due to time constraint this last part was never finished.
